## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Most labels are used across all Fluany repositories, but some are specific to `fluany/fluany`.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on `fluany/fluany` if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.
